{"name":"Zork","tagline":"","body":"# Welcome!\r\n<p align=\"justify\">\r\nThis is my Zork webpage. First of all, my game is inspired in the original Zork (if you want to play click [here](http://iplayif.com/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fzcode%2Fzdungeon.z5)) but the theme will be completely different: different story, map and items! Are you excited about how my game will look like? So here is a brief overview:\r\n\r\n###Overview\r\n<p align=\"justify\">\r\nIn this game you will feel like a survivor lost in the middle of an island trying to discover all paranormal activities to escape. Makalu Island is known for being extremely dangerous: anyone has left the place alive. But now it’s your turn! It doesn’t matter if you try to change the direction of your plane to avoid flying near Makalu that its mysterious force is going to catch you. That’s your destiny and you can’t do anything else.\r\n<p align=\"justify\">\r\nLuckily, you will survive to the accident. Going forward to the different areas you will find tons of objects that are going to help you during your adventure. Most of them are essential to go to a specific area so… pick them all! During the expedition you will also fight against wild animals and native tribes. \r\n<p align=\"justify\">\r\nItems are extremely basic: stick, boat, key, bottle, etc. But you can combine them with other elements of the environment so be careful and look around you: simple things had never been so important.\r\n\r\n#Makalu Island\r\n![Map]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcdp1997/Zork/master/Island%20map.jpg)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
